When we have lot of DOM (Dynamic Web Pages)

React JS
1. Zero DOM
Document.createElement(‘h2’); // it create a new h2,  so h2 will be render on screen (paint) pixels render (slow process)

DOM has some problems
1. Rendering
2. Dom has elements
e.g div , h2 , span
Dom elements are deep nested (Website is complex) so it take time to traverse and slow to identify where is the change?
Render the entire DOM Tree, Painting is slow , user experience is bad.
